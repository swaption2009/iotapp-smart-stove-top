Set the target temperature for a pot on your range top via a web page served directly from Intel® Edison, using your mobile phone. When the target temperature is reached, the speaker issues an audible notification. If an open flame from a pot boiling over is detected, alarm goes off. Optionally, all data can also be stored using the Intel IoT Example Datastore running in your own Microsoft* Azure* account.",
